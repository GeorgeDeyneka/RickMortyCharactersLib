## Usage

### Main Page
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
So, when you open the application, you see in front of you a small library consisting of Rick & Morty characters.
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
You can log in with your Google account by clicking on the button.
    </li>
        </br>
    <li>
Also, when you enter the page, you will see a modal window asking you to sign in with your Google account. After authorization, you can also log out by clicking on the block with information about your account.
    </li>
  </ul>

</div>

</br>

### Pagination
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
Please note that pagination has been added to the application to facilitate page navigation.
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
It works in conjunction with the browser's memory, so if you reload the page or view information about a certain character, don't worry: you will stay on the same page you were on.
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
I wrote this pagination myself, without using any third-party libraries at all.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </br>

</div>

</br>

---

### Details Page
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
When you click on a card with a character, you get to the details page.
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
Here you can view brief information about the character, as well as return to the main page.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </br>
<img src="demo-images/details.png" alt="details-page-demo" width="1000">
</div>

</br>

---

### Search
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
You can also search for the characters you need.
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
The search is case-insensitive, so if you write "RICK" or "ricK" for example, it won't affect the search results.
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
The search also works in conjunction with memory, so that when you reload or navigate to other pages, your input data will be saved.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </br>
